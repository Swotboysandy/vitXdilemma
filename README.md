## 🤔 What is this?

This is what happens when you have exams in **35 days** but you decide to build a study app instead of actually studying. *Priorities, am I right?*

It's basically a fancy flashcard app with way too many animations because CSS is more fun than memorizing CMMI levels.

## 🎯 Features (that you'll use once and forget)

- **250+ Quiz Questions** — Because rote learning is still a thing
- **Flashcards** — Flip cards like you're flipping through life decisions
- **Beautiful UI** — At least if you fail, you fail in style
- **Countdown Timer** — Watch your days disappear in real-time anxiety
- **ReactBits Animations** — Procrastination with extra steps
